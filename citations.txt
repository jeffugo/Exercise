Authors: Gooden, Caroline, Kearns, Jacqui Farmer
Publication Date - 2013
Description - During the early childhood years, responsive families and teachers are critical for rich stimulation of children's communication skills. Appropriate stimulation helps all areas of children's development (Bredekamp & Copple, 1997). Conversely, limited stimulation can significantly hinder a child's development (Hart & Risley, 1995). Since this area is so important to children's development, let's consider what we currently know about KY children's communication and some resources that support this important area.
